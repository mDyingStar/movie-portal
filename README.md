The application was launched to train the developer's personal skills in the full-stack area, specifically in the front-end. The movie portal always retrieves the latest film information from a public database through an API provided by https://developers.themoviedb.org/3. The developer wants to share the opportunity to improve their skills in the full-stack area with others, and therefore makes the project available as an open-source project.

The latest version of the master branch can be accessed at this link: https://mdyingstar.github.io/movie-portal/
## Movie-Portal

The movie portal can display all film trends based on selectable parameters. Additionally, there is the option to play various trailers.
Currently, the functionality is still under development and will offer many more possibilities in the future.
